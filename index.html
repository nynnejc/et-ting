                    <p>
                        We want to explore alternative tech futures and believe Donna Haraway can provide some theoretical and methodologically tools, that can be helpful in the search for identifying a plural, divers, inclusive, ecological and interdependent tech future.

                        Haraway is Professor in the History of Consciousness Department and Feminist Studies Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Her research interweaves information technology with feminist theory, just as she has influenced human-machine as well as human-animal studies, questioning the relations between humans and non-humans.

                    <p><b>About the book:</b>
                        <br />
                        In the midst of spiraling ecological devastation, multispecies feminist theorist Donna J. Haraway offers provocative new ways to reconfigure our relations to the earth and all its inhabitants. She eschews referring to our current epoch as the Anthropocene, preferring to conceptualize it as what she calls the Chthulucene, as it more aptly and fully describes our epoch as one in which the human and nonhuman are inextricably linked in tentacular practices. The Chthulucene, Haraway explains, requires sym-poiesis, or making-with, rather than auto-poiesis, or self-making. Learning to stay with the trouble of living and dying together on a damaged earth will prove more conducive to the kind of thinking that would provide the means to building more livable futures. Theoretically and methodologically driven by the signifier SF—string figures, science fact, science fiction, speculative feminism, speculative fabulation, so far—Staying with the Trouble further cements Haraway's reputation as one of the most daring and original thinkers of our time (Duke University Press)

                        This session is hosted by Et_ting (Nynne, Johanne and Tina). We hope that you want to discuss the book with us. You don’t need to have read any Haraway beforehand, you only need to be curious and open to explore the book and its subjects with us.</p>

                <p>Et_ting: Technology, Art & Design is a platform for meetings, discussions and knowledge production around technology, art and design.</p><br/>
                <p>We think alternative tech futures are urgently needed!</p>
                <p>We have therefore created Et_ting as a platform for seeking out new knowledge, asking questions, sharing ideas and we call for artists, designers and technologists that wants to contribute to developing these alternative tech futures - futures that a based on pluralistic, holistic, feminist, ecological (you put in the adjective you are longing for) ect. visions, imaginations and practices.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>‘Et ting’ is a Danish expression describing ‘an assembly where residents can meet to discuss and decide on matters of general interest and settle disputes’. You can find the word “ting” in Folketinget, the Danish word for Parliament. The idea for choosing this name is to invite more explorative, diverse, civil and democratic perspective into the creation of tech. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>Et_ting is Tina Ryoon Andersen, Nynne Just Christoffersen and Johanne Aarup Hansen.</p>
                <p>We have since 2017 run Tech & Science Book Club. We are now expanding into new formats.</p>
